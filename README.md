# openapi-problem

This repository contains OpenAPI data types for problem messages, compliant to [RFC 7807 - Problem Details for HTTP APIs](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807).
Their proper use is documented in the [REST guide](https://www.gcloud.belgium.be/rest/#error-handling).

Within a major version, types remain backwards compatible once they are released.
Types in a beta version are not included in releases and may change in a backwards incompatible way.
