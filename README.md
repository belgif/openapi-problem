# openapi-problem

This repository contains OpenAPI data types for problem messages, compliant to [RFC 9457 - Problem Details for HTTP APIs](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9457) (which obsoletes RFC 7807).
Their proper use is documented in the [REST guide](https://www.gcloud.belgium.be/rest/#error-handling).

Within a major version, types remain backwards compatible once they are released.
Types in a beta version are not included in releases and may change in a backwards incompatible way.

## build process

The build process is documented [here](https://github.com/belgif/openapi-common/blob/master/BUILDING.md).
